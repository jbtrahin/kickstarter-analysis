**Observations:** We have found that while there is only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the “plays” category is the most successful.

**Observations:** The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May. On the other hand, December doesn’t seem like a great time to launch a campaign.

**Visual 3:** Comparing the distribution of campaign goals and the distribution of total amounts pledged for plays in GB

**Observations:** From these plots, we can see that the mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
